To run the project code, you first need to download the two python files in this repository, which are cache_gen.py and main.py, to your 
loacl environment.

The cache_gen.py file is responsible for generating the caches which store the JSON files from the API.
The urls of the desired API are hardcoded in this python file, you just run it and the you will see three caches of JSON file
generated under the same repository as these two python files.

After running the cache_gen.py, you just need to simply run main.py and then the interaction with this project will start.

Have Fun !!!
